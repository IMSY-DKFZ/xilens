Supported cameras
=================

The database of supported cameras is generated by automatically scraping the main product page of `XIMEA <https://www.ximea.com/en/products>`_.
The script can be found in the `examples folder <https://github.com/IMSY-DKFZ/xilens/blob/develop/examples/update_camera_database.py>`_.

The database can be generated by doing the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install rich typer beautifulsoup4
    python update_camera_database.py scrap-page

After the script has finished, a JSON file is created on the current working directory.

.. warning::

    This script skips the `xiSpec` family because chroma and camera family can not be scraped from the webpage.
    `xiSpec` camera models are added to the database manually.

The latest version of the database containing all supported cameras can be found in the `resources folder <https://github.com/IMSY-DKFZ/xilens/blob/develop/resources/XiLensCameraProperties.json>`_.

Adding support for a new camera
===============================

Support for a new camera can be added by modifying the ``XiLensCameraProperties.json`` file with a new entry for a new
camera model. The location of hte file depends on where ``XiLens`` was installed. If the installation was done in ``/usr``,
then the file is located in ``/etc/xilens/XiLensCameraProperties.json``. If ``XiLens`` was only built but not installed in
the system, then the file should be located in the same directory as the executable.
The mosaic shape properties are only related to spectral cameras. ``RGB`` and ``Gray`` cameras should have a mosaic shape of ``0x0``.
