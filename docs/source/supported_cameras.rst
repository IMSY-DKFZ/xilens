Supported cameras
=================

The database of supported cameras is generated by automatically scraping the main product page of `XIMEA <https://www.ximea.com/en/products>`_.
The script can be found in the `examples folder <https://github.com/IMSY-DKFZ/xilens/blob/develop/examples/update_camera_database.py>`_.

The database can be generated by doing the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install rich typer beautifulsoup4
    python update_camera_database.py scrap-page

After the script has finished, a JSON file is created on the current working directory.

.. warning::

    This script skips the `xiSpec` family because chroma and camera family can not be scraped from the webpage.
    `xiSpec` camera models are added to the database manually.

The latest version of the database containing all supported cameras can be found in the `resources folder <https://github.com/IMSY-DKFZ/xilens/blob/develop/resources/XiLensCameraProperties.json>`_.
